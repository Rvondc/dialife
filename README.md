# DiaLife

## Module 1
The first three feature of DiaLife to delivered by the end of the month include:
1. Blood Glucose Tracking (Assigned to me)
2. BMI Tracking (Assigned to me)
3. Insulin Tracking (Assigned to von)

Each feature, all its widgets and logic, should be contained in its own folder (i.e. BMI Tracking feature should be placed in bmi_tracking).
