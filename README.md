# DiaLife

## Module 1
The first three features of DiaLife to delivered by the end of the month include:
1. Blood Glucose Tracking (Assigned to me)
2. BMI Tracking (Assigned to me)
3. Insulin Tracking (Assigned to von)

Each feature, all its widgets and logic, should be contained in its own folder (i.e. BMI Tracking feature should be placed in bmi_tracking). The GUI of the landing page is TBD.

**For now we should work on the specific logic of each feature** and either, implement a test GUI or write tests that ensure proper functionality. **Contributions should be made by forking the project, a branch should only be merged to master if it has been tested.**
